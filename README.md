# hello-world

Hello!

My name is Jenny Fan. I am a 9th grader.
My favorite subjects are math, physics, and computer science.
I play the clarinet as my main instrument and tennis as my main sport.
During my spare time, I like to listen to music, watch YouTube videos, 
    hang out with my friends, read books, and play games.
I also like origami and other arts and crafts.

I code in Python and Java.
